# About

This project is built on top of [bubbletea's viewport](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles/blob/master/viewport/viewport.go) to add vim-like search feature.

bindings:
- `/`: start search and go back to search from navigation mode
- `enter`: navigate forward through search results
- `shift+enter`: navigate backwards through search results
- `backspace`: exit search when search text area is empty
